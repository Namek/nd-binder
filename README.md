# What is it?

My small take on reproducing AngularJS by taking some modifications into account.

# Setup for build

`git submodule init && git submodule update`

`cd lib/js_expr`

`npm install`

`gulp build`

`cd ../..`

`npm install`

# Build

`gulp build` outputs library for browsers in `dist` folder
